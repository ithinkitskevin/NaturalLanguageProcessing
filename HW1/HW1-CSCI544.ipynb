The brook sound actually had a click at the end! However, the ocean and white noise had a good cycle.<br />Unfortunately, only after a year, it broke. Now, I'm looking for a better one with more sounds.  \n",
       "5094304                        I bought this product because it indicated 30 second heat up time.  It is great.  You plug it in, hit the on button, select a heat level (1-15) , and in less than 30 seconds it is hot.  No more waiting around for the iron to heat up.  Quick touch ups take no time at all. I'll never go back to the &quot;old style&quot; plug and wait.  \n",

It is stronger yet thinner; generates different vibrations (3) around the toothbrush head and varies this according to pressure.  Also has a built-in timer.  Enjoy!  \n",

It's easy to use, and it trains aggressive brushers (read: Type As) to treat their gums with a little more TLC. Your teeth feel cleaner longer after using a sonicare. It's almost like getting a full dental cleaning every time you brush.  \n",
