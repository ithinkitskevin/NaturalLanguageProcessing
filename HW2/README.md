# HW2
nltk                          3.7

### To run
I've used python 3.9. To run the code, go to the hw2/ folder, and there run 
```
python .\hw2.py
```

To produce the following files, at the end of hw2.py, run the same command. The hw2.py should produce not just the questions asked in the Assignment, but also create the files. The files creation all start after line 323 in the python file. 

I'm utilizing *_6.obj to save emission and transition probabilities. I have it set up so you can check out other probabilities with different threshold. 

_2 and _4 : 3

_3 : 5

_5 : 10
